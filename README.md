# Age Verification Plugin

The **Age Verification** Plugin is an extension for [Grav CMS](https://github.com/getgrav/grav). 

## Installation

### Manual Installation

To install the plugin manually, download the zip-version of this repository and unzip it under `/your/site/grav/user/plugins`. Then rename the folder to `age-verification`. You can find these files on [GitHub](https://github.com/nmorajda/grav-plugin-age-verification).

You should now have all the plugin files under

    /your/site/grav/user/plugins/age-verification
	
## Usage

Once installed, the plugin will prompt users to confirm they are 18 years or older before accessing the site's content. 

## Why Server-Side Verification

Age verification is handled server-side to ensure that access restrictions cannot be bypassed by disabling JavaScript or manipulating client-side scripts. This approach provides a more secure and reliable method of enforcing age restrictions.
